# World Conquest: Wesnoth with friends

One of the joys of Wesnoth is amassing an army of high-level recruits over a long campaign. When playing with friends, though, most multiplayer games are short, one-off encounters. When the scenario ends, you can say goodbye to that Red Mage you painstakingly leveled up.

Wouldn't it be great if you could play a whole campaign with friends? Well you can with **World Conquest**, a randomly-generated coop campaign for 1-3 players. Since including it in our 1.16 release, it's become the second-most popular game on our multiplayer server.

## What to expect

A game of **World Conquest** works like any other Wesnoth campaign. You'll need to seize villages and kill enemy leaders to win. When you recruit your first unit, you can choose bonuses for your side by giving them artifacts, training and heroes.

Every time you win and start a new scenario, you'll get to choose another set of bonuses. Choose carefully! The right bonus combos can really increase the power of your units.

## A different campaign every time

Every campaign in **World Conquest** is randomly generated -- random maps, random enemies, random heroes, random bonuses. It's a great way to try out a new strategy or faction, like the Dunefolk we introduced in the last release.
