# World Conquest: Wesnoth with friends

One of the joys of Wesnoth is amassing an army of high-level recruits over a long campaign. When playing with friends, though, most multiplayer games are short, one-off encounters. When the scenario ends, you can say goodbye to that Red Mage you painstakingly levelled up.

Wouldn't it be great if you could play a whole campaign with friends? Well, you can with **World Conquest**, a randomly-generated Co-Op campaign for 1-3 players. Since including it in our 1.16 release, it's become the second-most popular game on our multiplayer server.

## What is World Conquest?

World Conquest is a cooperative focused MP-campaign with high emphasis on army building and further augmentation of army composition with various modifiers such as artifact drops, training, and discoverable heroes. Each level exhibits increasing levels of epic-ness so the player team will be met with a truly satisfying experience either with a win or a loss.

The objective in **World Conquest** is as follows:
- Build up your army
- Establish firm control over the map (capture villages and create defensive lines)
- Take down enemy leaders and dispatch their pesky commanders
- Augment your units with artifacts and training
- Discover a map's secret/bonus points
- Cooperate with your teammates to win

When you recruit your first unit, you can choose bonuses for your side by giving them artifacts, training and heroes.

Every time you win and start a new scenario, you'll get to choose another set of bonuses. Choose carefully! The right bonus combos can really increase the power of your units.

**World Conquest** also comes packaged with its own remixed Default Era which mixes and matches the Default factions into tailored pairings. A unique mechanic is that one unit of a pair is recruited, the next time the recruitment menu is opened, you can see that the unit has been replaced by its pair and this cycles for each of the pairings. This opens possibilities of greater variety of army compositions.

## A Different Campaign Experience every Session

Every scenario in **World Conquest** is randomly generated - random maps, random enemies, random heroes, random bonuses. It's a great way to try out a new strategy or faction, like the Dunefolk we introduced in the last release.

The 1.17.x release of World Conquest offers an experimental 4-player version of it and three new Dunefolk-themed factions to the World Conquest Era. The developers of Battle for Wesnoth are looking for playtesters to test it and give some feedback. Do help out if you can.
