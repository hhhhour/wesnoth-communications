# Continue your adventure with the most popular campaign add-ons

Battle for Wesnoth comes with almost 20 single-player campaigns set in the wide green world of [Irdya](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Geography_of_wesnoth). You can play as a young heir fighting to restore his throne, a king desparate to save his people, or the instigator of a peasant revolt. You can lead a dwarven expedition to uncover a lost relic in one campaign. Or crush the rivals of your Orcish clan to unite the Great Horde in another. You can even play as wayward magi drawn inexoribly, disastrously to the darkest of their arts.

There is no central hero who dominates the history of the Great Continent and no single story around which the world pivots. Like the best fan-fiction, Wesnoth's lore is made up of many voices with many stories to tell.

As a result, our user community has written more than 100 campaign add-ons. Many of these are set in Irdya and expand upon little-explored races or fill in gaps in the game's timeline. Others are set in their own universe.

In this post, we want to celebrate the most popular user-made campaigns available on the add-on server. The stories these campaigns tell are not part of the official lore -- what we like to call Wesnoth's "canon" -- but they have each become very popular amongst our player community.
